there are two types of graphs directed and undirected 
they connsist of node and vertices 
a node can appear only once in  a path
degree of the node - number of maax edges attached to a node.
total degree of  a graph = 2 * edges
indegree= the number of edges coming inside and outdegree the number of edges going ooutside
